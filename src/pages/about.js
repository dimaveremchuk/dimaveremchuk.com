                  <p>
                  My journey into design has been unconventional. For the first ten years of my professional life, I worked as a finance and business consultant. Immersed in studying business theories and observing various companies, I gained insight into what drives businesses and how they cater to their customers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  My fascination with the digital world began early, during my school years, when I first experimented with various computer programs, exploring 3D design, web design, and programming. Later in life, I would spend hours discerning the best-designed software and apps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  In 2018, I made a pivotal decision to shift my focus from advising companies on their financials to leveraging my long-held passion for digital products. I left my job and embarked on a six-month journey to South-East Asia to recharge and immerse myself in the world of product design. There, I began taking on freelance design projects and secured my first full-time product design role.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  With product design as my primary expertise and passion, I also dabble in front-end development, iOS native development, graphic design, and 3D.
